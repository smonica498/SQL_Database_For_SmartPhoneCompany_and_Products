Question: Create a database with two tables: ‘SMART PHONE COMPANY’ (e.g. Apple, Samsung) and ‘SMART PHONE PRODUCTS’ (IPHONE 10, GALAXY S11). The idea is that a phone company would have manufactured many smart phones, but a given phone can be manufactured by only one company. With these basic rules, please execute the following:
•	Write the DDL for creating two tables (create any reasonable set of attributes for the two tables). Do not allow nulls. Ensure that all the constraints are table constraints and NOT column constraints. Ensure to enforce essential integrity constraints.
•	Primary key of the ‘SMART PHONE COMPANY’ table should be auto-numbered (i.e. the field values are autogenerated and incremented by specific amount for every new row).
•	Create the relationship diagram between the two tables. 

Note:
To enter data into the table:
e.g. Select that Dept table, Right click on it, Edit Top 200 Rows
Right click on table dept, select top 1000 rows

Code:
CREATE TABLE SmartPhoneCompany(
CompanyID INT NOT NULL IDENTITY(1,1),
CompanyName CHAR(40) NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT COMPANY_PK PRIMARY KEY(CompanyID)
);

CREATE TABLE SmartPhoneProducts(
ProductID INT NOT NULL,
ProductName CHAR(40) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'TOUCH TO DIE II',
CompanyNumb INT NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT PRODUCT_PK PRIMARY KEY(ProductID,CompanyNumb),
CONSTRAINT COMPANY_PRODUCT_FK FOREIGN KEY(CompanyNumb)
            REFERENCES SmartPhoneCompany(CompanyID)
			ON UPDATE CASCADE
			ON DELETE CASCADE
);
